## Controls for Custom GUI Viewer

The current built-in image viewer in Kodi suffers from an issue where it attempts to read all images in a directory before presenting them.

This can be extremely time consuming depending on the directory size.

The custom GUI based at [PyXBMCt](https://github.com/romanvm/script.module.pyxbmct) and [PIL](https://github.com/mrdominuzq/script.module.pil) / [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) improves this by loading only one image at time.

For systems where PIL is not usable due [know issues](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/21531) (android x86 for example), `Scale Up` function will not be able to `Move Up` or `Move Down`.
